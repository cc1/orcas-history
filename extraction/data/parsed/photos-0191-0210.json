I spotted a boat like this while attending the Sammamish Slough Races in Bothell and immediately knew I had to have one like it. I followed the boat to the launch ramp and met the owner who turned out to be the builder as well.  He agree to build me a \"shell\" a completely unfinished wooden hull that I could finish out myself.  That became a winters project while going to Garfield High School. It was kept in my grandmothers old garage in the alley during construction and after.  The top was beautiful mahogany plywood which I coated with glass cloth and resin (just like the builder had done).  I found a used 6 cylinder 70 hp Mercury outboard that needed some work, which I was able to do.  It was a direct drive outboard - that is, no shift, and no reverse.  When you started it you were going, and you had better have it pointed in the right direction.  It nearly jumped out of the water - and was a great ski boat for anyone who wished to chance it.  In return they would then have to drive the boat so I could ski!  That thing flew - without a doubt one of the fastest things any where near Pt. Lawrence.  I sold it a couple of years later to buy an inboard boat which I named Circe' after the Greek Goddess of Magic.  (Ken)","source":"Ken Culver","hasHighRes":true,"notes":"TBD"},

We often stayed with them at their home in Northgate up on the hill behind where the Northgate Mall would be located now.  Roy had the first TV I ever layed eyes on - a huge wooden floor standing cabinet with a little round TV screen perhaps 6 or 8\" across.  Most of the time it just had a test Pattern as programs were only broadcast in the evening hours.  The image was small, grainy, and often had \"ghosts\" caused by over the air signals bouncing off of airplanes, or trees./  Sometimes a low flying plane would cause the picture to waiver and flop so badly you could not watch until the plane was well past the line of interference.  I sat on the floor while Roy \"tuned\" it to get the picture to come in.  He was not a man of means - but he certainly was an early adoptor.  (Ken)"},

The counter to the far left was where Carroll sat on a stool each day to write, check his stock portfolio, and do Resort business.  Behind him was the kitchen table with the door leading out to the back concrete stairs that are still used today.  Note the little Philco radio sitting on the table.  It replaced an antique RCA (arched wood radio) that I still have the frame of in my basement shop.  He checked the radio twice a day - in the morning to get the opening stock report and at noon to get the closing report along with the news broadcast from Paul Harvey - a voice that was almost part of the family all of my life there and even after I left.  \"And now you have the rest of the story\" - one of Paul's most famous lines."},
