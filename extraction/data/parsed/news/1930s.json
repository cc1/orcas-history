Nearhoff was owner of the ferry City of Clinton, which was insured as a carrier between Lummi and Orcas. She burned on March 23, 1929, while being taken from Everett to Seattle for repairs. The high court held that although the ferry burned while off her regular run, Nearheff was entitled to the fire insurance. (Seattle Daily Times)"
