Immediately to its right was a trap door in the float that lifted up to reveal a herring live box with herring swimming around and cod fish and the occasional dogfish lurking wantingly on the other side of the screen.  We used a dip net to get out as many as the fisherman wanted to buy.  $1 per dozen was the going rate for live herring.   (Ken)","source":"Ken Culver","hasHighRes":true,"notes":"TBD"},
