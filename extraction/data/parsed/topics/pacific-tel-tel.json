      "content": "\"Telephones were first installed on the east end of Orcas Island in 1906. Long distance to the mainland was established at the same time. That was also when the instrument that is now displayed in the Orcas Historical Museum was put into use in our home, where it stayed until dial phones were installed in the fifties.\n\nAll of the island, from Rosario south, was on one line; we all heard everyone's ring. In the late twenties there were nineteen different rings on the line, making it very difficult to distinguish who was being called. One ring reached \"Central\", and five long rings was the emergency signal, calling for everyone to come on the one and listen or help.\n\nListening in to other people's phone calls was called \"rubbering\", though I don't know why. It was a fine way to learn who was coming and going.\n\nOne telephone incident frightened me as a small child. There were rum-runners who made their headquarters in a small shack at Obstruction Pass. Apparently something went wrong with one of their shipments. Mr. Shively, a very large, fierce-looking man, came to our place, which had the only phone in the area, to make a call about that shipment. In his anger, Mr. Shively did not lift the receiver from the hook, he pulled it through the heavy spring steel prongs.\n\nThat really impressed me. Afterwards, I tried many times to pull the receiver through those prongs, but I could not.\""
