Lawrence Lodge","people":"NA","description":"The year of the big snow.  We were snowed and frozen in for several weeks.  Roads impassable, power out much of the time, and all water pipes frozen.  My dad carried water from Alderbrook Creek.  The Doe Bay school bus could not run, but school went on for the western half of the Island.  My Mom put me on the Osage at Doe Bay and I got off at Eastsound where I stayed for about a week with Perry Kimple , one of my classmates.  The Kimples owned the local telephone company and Mrs. Kimple was the operator who sat in a little bay window on the street side of the house and plugged callers into various little round holes to connect with people outside their immediate party line.  I was fascinated to watch as she sat there for hours with a little headset and speaker.  She could leave her station and still hear if someone rang for the operator (1 long crank).  She would step out of the kitchen and  connect them.  The system was shut down at night, however in an emergency you could call and wake her up.  Clara Abrahamson of Doe Bay also worked as an operator.  (Ken)","source":"Ken Culver","notes":"TBD","hasHighRes":true},

Lawrence Lodge","people":"Ken Culver","description":"Ken with a couple of nice Silvers.  If I recall this was my birthday, when I always got the day off - spared from the chores of the resort.  Usually I chose to take one of the rental boats and go fishing on the North Shore by myself.   Mid to late August was when the Silvers would show up in droves, usually working their way down the North Shore towards Pt. Lawrence.  I would cut herring strips with a  4 oz crescent sinker and troll close to the surface.  You could often see the fish come flashing across the water like a torpedo and hit that bait - Boom!  You had a fight on your hands - Silvers were high energy, often making long surface runs and tail walking in an attempt to toss the hooks.  Little Jack salmon were so common at that time that I often tied a Pearl Wobbler or 4 1/2 McMahon spoon onto a short hand line and dragged it about 15 feet behind the boat with no weight.  That would keep the jacks from stealing your fresh cut herring strip.   (Ken)","source":"Ken Culver","notes":"TBD","hasHighRes":true},

Cap Bell was a local character, and I do mean character, that often hung around the Lodge and lived at one point or another in Cabin 4.  He caught herring to sell for bait, and stored them in a floating live box anchored in the bay.  Cap often used a herring rake to impale herring, and was not above using a half stick of dynamite if there was a large herring ball out in front.  He would light a short fuse, and quickly drop it over the side.  A large muffled thud would be heard, and then hundreds of stunned herring would come to the surface for easy netting.  That process was outlawed and may have even been illegal at the time.  When we tore down Cabin 4 we found a package wrapped in heavy brown waxed paper.  It was several sticks of dynamite - old Cap Bell had them hidden up in the floor joists.  (Ken)","source":"Ken Culver","notes":"TBD","hasHighRes":true},
