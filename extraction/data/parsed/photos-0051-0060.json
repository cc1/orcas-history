Lawrence Lodge","people":"TBD","description":"Derby winner with 50 lb plus King Salmon.  This fish was hooked at dusk and was fought into the night creating concern on shore as the only boat not to return.  A crowd gathered when they heard the sound of a small outboard coming from the direction of North Peapod Island.  She fought this giant fish and drifted from Pt. Lawrence to Peapod before it was gaffed.  Fish this big were too big for nets of the day, so it was gaffed instead.  A real art, and the source of many fish knocked off the hook by an inexperienced helper in the boat.  Note my father's ingenious method of making the fish look even larger than it really is.  He devised a hook mounted on a broomstick which that small woman is simply holding steady out in front of her.  Always hold your fish out in front when you are getting your photo taken!
