It had a well stocked store, a post office, sold gas, and was adjacent to the Doe Bay Community Dock where the Mailboat Osage stopped daily.  The store was in front and in the back overlooking Doe Bay was a pub with tables and booths lined around the outside edge.  In my lifetime this never operated, instead serving as a place for local kids to shoot baskets when the weather was inclement.  In the \"off season\" there were often square dances and a potluck - the kids tore around until they got tired and then slept in their parents cars until the party was over.","hasHighRes":true},
