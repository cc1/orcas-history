      "description": "At Snoqualamie Summit. Possibly on a winter trip to visit the Atwood family in Yakima. Dr. Atwood and family came and stayed in cabin 1 for two weeks each summer for many years. Carl Atwood and I became friends as I introduced him to all the wonders of summer life at Orcas. Carl and I attended the U of W at the same time and lived next door to each other in separate fraternities. We are still in contact. Carl has written a wonderful account of his time at Orcas called \"Two Weeks in August\" which I have a copy of. (Ken)",

      "description": "I have never seen this amazing photo or known about the overhead boat launch system being used then. I have often wondered about the double doors in the boathouse - now I know why they are there. Notice the tent platform over where Cabin 12 would ultimately be built many years later. People would pitch a tent on that wooden platform. I suspect that those small concrete footings and spindly posts did not fair well in winter storms and were replaced with an inclined railway that connected to the main platform just outside the boathouse doors. Neither one survived the winter storms without damage. Ultimately the marine railway was constructed using concrete piers, actual steel rail track, and was located on the lower (little) platform near the fish scales and ramp to the floats. Boats were launched and retrieved with a \"dolly\" that ran on the track, connected to a greased cable that ran up to the winch at the top. Going down was dangerous. You learned to use the hand brake so that the boat would not get going too fast! (Ken)",
