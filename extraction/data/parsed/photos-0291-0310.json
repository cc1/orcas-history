Possibly on a winter trip to visit the Atwood family in Yakima.  Dr. Atwood and family came and stayed in cabin 1 for two weeks each summer for many years.  Carl Atwood and I became friends as I introduced him to all the wonders of summer life at Orcas.  Carl and I attended the U of W at the same time and lived next door to each other in separate fraternities.  We are still in contact.  Carl has written a wonderful account of his time at Orcas called \"Two Weeks in August\"  which I have a copy of.(Ken)","source":"Ken Culver","hasHighRes":true,"notes":"TBD"},

I have often wondered about the double doors in the boathouse - now I know why they are there.  Notice the tent platform over where Cabin 12 would ultimately be built many years later.  People would pitch a tent on that wooden platform. I suspect that those small concrete footings and spindly posts did not fair well in winter storms and were replaced with an inclined railway that connected to the main platform just outside the boathouse doors.  Neither one survived the winter storms without damage.  Ultimately the marine railway was constructed using concrete piers, actual steel rail track, and was located on the lower (little) platform near the fish scales and ramp to the floats.  Boats were launched and retreived with a \"dolly\" that ran on the track, connected to a greased cable, which in turn was connected to a winch which had to be handcranked.  It had 2 gears - low gear was required to haul a heavy boat out and high gear would get it done quicker for a lighter load.  Being the boat hauler for the resort was always one of my most feared tasks because of the chance a cable or gear might break under the strain.","source":"Ken Culver","hasHighRes":true,"notes":"TBD"},

I have reason to believe the cabin on the left which looks like cabin 3 was actually destroyed by a huge tree that fell.  See Photos 0066,0067 and 0068.  The spacing in this photo would not have allowed for cabin 2 and the bath house so what became cabin 3 was either moved or completely rebuilt closer to cabin 4.","source":"Ken Culver","hasHighRes":true,"notes":"TBD"},
