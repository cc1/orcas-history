  "biography": "From obituary (August 9, 2008):\n\nBorn May 18, 1935, to Helge and Florian (Culver) Johanson, Larry was a lifetime resident of Bellingham until five years ago when he and his wife of 50 years Beverly (Curtis), moved to the family property on Doe Bay, Orcas Island. He was a graduate of Campus School, Bellingham High School and the University of Washington, where he made lifelong ties with his Delta Tau Delta fraternity brothers. In 1959, he joined his father at Helge Johanson Insurance and later the next year he and Bev spent a memorable summer in London, where Larry studied at Lloyd's of London. In 1970 he co-founded Griffin Garrett Johanson.\n\nLarry Johanson was an excellent and civic-minded businessman, a loving family man and loyal friend with a sometimes maddeningly keen eye for detail, a talent for reading a room and a remarkable ability to capture a person, a moment or an idea with a well-turned phrase or a droll comment, or both. Known for his quick wit, long stories and conversational prowess, Larry had a gift for putting people at ease and made doing so a priority. He loved nothing so much as a visit with friends or family — if the subjects of boats, fishing, Husky football or business came up, so much the better.",
