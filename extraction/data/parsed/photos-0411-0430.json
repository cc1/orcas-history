The Cedar was all beach combed from local beaches, cut into lengths, and then into stacks of shake 'bolts'. The bolts were split into 'barn shakes'. This made for a shake that was the same thickness from top to bottom. Barn shakes are thinner than traditional shakes and dry out more quickly so they last longer. Traditional 'tapered' shakes required turning over the bolt each time, resulting in a taper. Hand split cedar shakes were the longest lasting because the surface of the shake followed the grain of the wood, creating minute channels to carry away the water. Sawed shakes tended to be much more uniform, but they absorbed water and often rotted much sooner. Between Marcia and I we split enough shakes that summer to cover both Cabin 1 and 5 which were now joined together. (Ken)",
