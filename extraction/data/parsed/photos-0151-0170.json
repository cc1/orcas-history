Also no garage/woodshed/storeroom yet. Note the huge fir tree towering over the lodge on the side of the hill above the parking lot. Sometime after this photo, when I was a small boy, a logger climbed that tree using spiked climbers and topped about 50 feet using a hand saw. I will never forget the image of the logger hanging on for dear life as the remainder of the tree swung wildly back and forth in a huge arc after the top of the tree came crashing down. The large box on the beach at the far left looks like part of the floating bait box used by Cap. Bell.  (Ken)","source":"Ken Culver","hasHighRes":true,"notes":"TBD"}
