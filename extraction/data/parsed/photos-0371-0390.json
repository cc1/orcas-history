There appear to be 2 inboard Reinell boats - one on the buoy, and one at the floats.   The other interesting thing is the large open skiff on the outside of the main float.  I vaguely remember this boat coming from Bellingham to fish, and believe the owner built it himself.  I want to say his name was Vanderford and he often stayed in the little \"trailer house\" up behind the Lodge over by the camping area.  I was intrigued by this boat as it had an inboard engine and could plane.  The owner stood straight up in the middle of the boat and steered with a \"stick\" which was connected by ropes and pulleys to the rudder. (Ken)",

The main Lodge, cedar log floats, and 16' Reinell cedar planked rental boats. The boat on the right was an inboard—it had a little air cooled Wisconsin engine and a rope/tiller steering system. Top speed was not enough to buck the big incoming tides but it was quiet and burned next to no gas. Note the garage building just to the left of the Lodge. You can also see tents pitched to the right of the Lodge, which is now State Park land.  (Ken)",
