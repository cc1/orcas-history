There appear to be 2 inboard Reinell boats - one on the buoy, and one at the floats. The other interesting thing is the large open skiff on the outside of the main float. I vaguely remember this boat coming from Bellingham to fish, and believe the owner built it himself. I want to say his name was Vanderford and he often stayed in the little 'trailer house' up behind the Lodge over by the camping area. I was intrigued by this boat as it had an inboard engine and could plane. The owner stood straight up in the middle of the boat and steered with a 'stick' which was connected by ropes and pulleys to the rudder. (Ken)",

The main Lodge, cedar log floats, and 16' Reinell cedar planked rental boats. The boat on the right was an inboard - it had a little air cooled Wisconsin engine and a rope/tiller steering system. Top speed was not enough to buck the big incoming tides but it was quiet and burned next to no gas. Note the garage building just to the left of the Lodge. You can also see tents pitched to the right of the Lodge, which is now State Park land. (Ken)",

This was at best a 'tent frame' when I was a child. The final cabin #12 was built here around 1950 and still stands on the site. The overhead ramp to the Lodge had not been constructed yet, and the boat launch had changed to a marine railway that came off the main boathouse platform. My guess is that this, as well as the earlier overhead boat launch did not fair well in winter storms. Also the elevation of the boathouse made it too steep and required lots of maneuvering to position a boat for launch. Ultimately the area down by the smoke house became the 'lower platform' with a hand cranked winch marine rail way to launch and retrieve boats. (Ken)",

Of Note: There is a post on the little point at the far right of the photo. This was a fence post with 'sheep fence wire' running up into the woods behind the camping area and outhouses. Its purpose was to prevent the sheep that Carroll was raising from getting down onto the beach and onto the property (which guests loved and he hated), as they are basically stupid animals that are very challenging to herd. The sheep had free reign of all the land down to the Point and up the North Shore. When it was time to shear them for their wool the flock had to be located and then driven all the way back to the barn at Alderwood. This often took most of a day, and a number of people, since we had no sheep dogs. Occasionally the lead sheep would bolt and double back and the whole flock would follow. (Ken)",
