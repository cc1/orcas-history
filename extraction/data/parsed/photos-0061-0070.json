Lawrence Lodge","people":"TBD","description":"The Lodge and beach in 1935 - no floats yet, no overhead walkway. Campers on the beach, which is what inspired Carroll Culver to consider starting a fishing resort. All the boats except one appear to be inboards—outboards were not big enough to make the trip from the mainland. Notice the smoke coming up from the smokehouse! Also notice the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph phone lines on the hill behind the Lodge .  The lines  terminated at the second beach from Pt. Lawrence where the cable went underwater to Lummi Island. Also notice the lack of trees and vegetation - likely caused by a fire years before.

Lawrence Lodge","people":"TBD","description":"A huge derby gathering.  In 1939 there were floats made of cedar logs and planks, anchored with cables to cement blocks.  The large vessel at the end of the dock was the Coast Guard cutter - 83' powered by two huge gasoline engines (Kermaths I believe).  The exhaust was an amazing throaty roar—very impressive for a young kid. The flat bottom skiff on the beach to the right was built by the Reinell Boat Co. in Marysville (as were all the rental boats).  It was 14' long and had two sets of oarlocks so that two people could row at the same time.  It was occasionally rented by fishermen who wanted to catch cod in the nearby kelp beds or even troll for salmon.  In those days you could catch a salmon just off the floats!  Ken, Bruce, and Carolyn Culver all spent countless hours rowing that little boat, and then graduating to a 2 1/2 hp Lawson air cooled rope start outboard.  That was really living!  I distinctly remember the approved method of docking was to come into the float head on (crash!) and then run up and tie off. (Ken)","source":"Ken Culver","notes":"TBD","hasHighRes":true}
