Lack of mechanization made early farming an arduous task requiring more labor than was often available in one family. On certain occasions, such as harvest time, neighbors would team up and help one another. Other times it was necessary to hire help, and there were plenty of young men around who needed work. This photograph shows Cecil Willis, son of Richard Willis, who has been hired to help bring in the hay on Alderbrook Farm.
