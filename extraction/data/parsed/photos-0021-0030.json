Note the vertical log bulkhead replaced in the mid 50's with a concrete bulkhead.  The overhead ramp extending from the lodge porch to the stairway (unbuilt) to the left of the garage had not been constructed yet.  Also note the boat launch rail and track system from the platform on the left, and a smaller ramp on the right hand end which I believe was for access during construction.  My guess is this is circa 1935-40.   171 Jacobsen on the postcard is a reference to Jacobsen photography studios in Bellingham","source":"Orcas Island History Museum","notes":null,"hasHighRes":false},

I recognize Louis Adelstein (3rd from left) a cigar chomping character from Bellingham.","description":"Very likely a small derby with the participants.  These were newsworthy events at that time.

There is no protection at Doe Bay and the dock was often damaged, ultimately falling into disrepair and torn down.

If he had a little extra time he would let me sit in the pilots seat!  Very exciting for me - probably about 8 yrs old at the time.
