This circa 1910 photograph shows the 15-acre apple and prune orchard that surrounded the house. Additional acreage was given over to raising cattle and Oxford down sheep.

The site was picked because it contained the most easterly location for a steamboat landing in a well sheltered cove. The farmhouse remains to this day in its original condition with no indoor plumbing or electricity. It is now a designated State Historic Site. All other buildings slowly deteriorated and collapsed over time. The last to go was the big hay barn seen to the left of the Farmhouse. When it finally collapsed I salvaged several of the weathered cedar 1x12 barn siding boards which later became an interior wall of the Culver Family cabin at Pt. Lawrence.  (Ken)","hasHighRes":true},

Lawrence Lodge","people":"Carroll Culver","description":"Carroll loading green alder onto a hot bed of coals at the smokehouse, which was built of green lumber.  Carroll did not \"smoke\" like so many did, but instead \"kippered\" resulting in a moist, soft, smoke which retained more oil.  The technique involved filleting then cutting the fillets into chunks.  The chunks were then brined in metal buckets over night using a recipe that was written on the boat house wall (I still have it).  Each bucket, when carefully filled with layers of salmon or herring, was covered with a heavy wooden top held down by a brick.  In the morning he would start a hot fire using cedar kindling and dry alder.  This could be risky as it would become a roaring fire which on numerous occasions caught the smoke house on fire - but a quick bucket brigade using salt water always spared it.  When the fire settled down to hot glowing coals he would then lay on fresh cut green alder and just let it smolder and smoke until the fire ultimately went out.  That evening he would pick the still warm pieces from the screened racks - there was never a better tasting piece of fish in my opinion.  Since freezing was still not available, most fish were canned, either smoked or unsmoked, using a large pressure cooker with the fish stuffed carefully into each open can and placed in the pressure cooker on top of the huge kitchen wood stove range.  You can imagine the heat in that kitchen on a hot summer day !  After opening, the hot cans were sealed using a Burpee hand crank lid sealer (often my job) and set aside to cool.  You had to wait for each can to \"sing\" or make a popping sign, indicating a good vacumn seal had been accomplished.    (Ken)","source":"Ken Culver","notes":"TBD","hasHighRes":true},

The only bathrooms at that time for the cabins. Each side had a single shower, with hot water furnished by a wood heater located in the middle of the cabin, and requiring the user to build a hot fire for at least an hour ahead of time.  Since the water pressure was low (gravity system then) it was common practice to yell \"flushing\" in case someone was showering on the other side so that they did not get scalded.  There was no thermostat and the hotter the fire the hotter the water could get.","source":"Ken Culver","notes":"TBD","hasHighRes":true},
