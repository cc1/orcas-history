Seeing that large fish tail tied reminds me of a fishing trip that Kathleen and I took along with a number of my male friends from Bellingham to the Broughton Islands (she was the only female).  Fishing was lousy, even worse than lousy.  On our last day the VHF radio crackled  to life to say that Larry Johanson had hooked a big one in his boat, and was just getting ready to land it.  We pulled up close in our boat and Dave Blair asked Larry to hold the fish up by the tail.  Larry tried, but the fish slipped right through his hands.  He tried and tried, to the uproarious laughter from our boat.  Dave said \" Larry - that is not a King Salmon - that is a very nice (but illegal) silver salmon.!\"  Larry turned beet red, then made a nice recovery and hastily said \"We are heading back to the dock - and by the way we are having fresh caught King Salmon for lunch\".  Destroying the evidence - also illegal.  Having grown up at a fishing resort I had heard that you could never hold a Silver by the tail - that it would simply fold up in your hands and slip through. Try it some time.   (Ken)"},
