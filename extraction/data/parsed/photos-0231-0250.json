Over the years he appeared on stage as Charlie Chaplin (very funny skit with camera on tripod that would not stand up when he turned around) and Al Jolson (one of his favorite singers). Yes, he appeared in black face with the big white lips - I believe it was pantomime.  Not sure what this one was as I did not see it.    (Ken)"},
