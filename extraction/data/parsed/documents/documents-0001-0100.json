The view is from the road to Pt. Lawrence Lodge just above what has always been referred to as the \"Rocky Turn\".  Alders have obscured much of this view today.  The painting hangs in the dining room of the Gamwell House owned by Ken and Marcia Culver.  I am particularly fond of this view, as it is the peek a boo view I got each time we drove or walked the road.  At the bottom of this photo is the ravine that contains Alderbrook Creek. \n\nA rock masonry wall had been built up on the edge of a small waterfall, providing a foot bridge across the creek during low water months.  It was a definite shortcut rather than walking to the road into the Farmhouse from the main road!  Much of that wall remains today.\n\nKen Culver\n\nD&O 0008\n\nDescription: Oil painting by Diana Aikens. This painting appears in photograph 0412 hanging in the parlor of the Alderbrook farmhouse.

Yes\n\nOther Notes: TBD\n\nD&O 0017\n\nDescription: Letter to Ken Culver from Carroll Culver, Part 2 of 2.  The \"two local boys\" mentioned in the letter were Bob Patton and Harry Patton.  Their parents bought property from the Culvers and built a home on Patton Point, which remains in their family today.  Bob and Harry Patton were both fighter pilots in the Korean War.  Following the war, they continued to fly out of Whidbey Naval Air Base as \"weekend warriors\". The Patton boys often would \"buzz\" their home at Patton's point in separate planes, flying super low in close formation, and then pulling up in a steep climb as they passed Pt. Lawrence . The noise and shear chutzpah of the whole thing was mind boggling to this small boy. Totally illegal I suspect, even then. Bob held a summer job at Pt. Lawrence Lodge as a \"dock boy\" - something he fondly remembers along with a couple of other \"dock boys\" in the early years including Bill Trogdon and Al Ulbrichson Jr. (the son of the famous Husky Crew Coach) who had a summer place at Eastsound or West Sound).  I have a feeling this may have influenced my decision to row for the U of W.  (Ken)\n\nD&O 0018\n\nDescription: A poem to me from my father, typed on the old Smith Corona which inexplicably had a blue ribbon.  I spent every summer after my parents divorce at Pt. Lawrence.  During school year I lived with my mother, step father, and sister in Seattle. Other than the occasional collect call from Rosario, I was virtually without communications with the folks back home.  Carroll was devoted and sent occasional silly, fun letters and this one little poem—which I have preserved in this manner elsewhere in this digital record.\n\nKen Culver\n\nDimensions: 8.5\" x 11\"\n\nSource: Ken Culver\n\nDo we have a high-res scan at this time?

Part 1 of 2. The building of the road leading fom the existing Johanson driveway to the Point containing the homes of Fickels and Judsons  was a cause for celebration and a good party—as was almost any event for that crowd in that era.  A large crowd was in attendance, people were formally dressed, some in top hats, and speeches were made.  There was a formal ribbon cutting—then let the party begin!  Helge and Carroll spent years ribbing each other—as should be evident in this speech. All in good fun.
