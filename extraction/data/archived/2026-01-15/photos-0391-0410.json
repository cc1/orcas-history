No gear shift - so you had to plan ahead before starting it as you would lunge ahead once it fired. (Ken)",

Launching and retrieving the floats was a huge job, involving jacks, pulleys, planks, and rollers (the round cores of logs that had been peeled by a plywood mill in Bellingham.) The process took several days in and out, and had to be coordinated with large tides. Weather was critical so floats were generally not put in the water until close to Memorial Day and always taken out by September 15 as my father worried about the 1st big fall storm coming any time after. The large box with what appear to be windows is the floating live box that would be anchored in the bay. The large box laying on its side on top of the float was the small live box that would be placed under a trap door in the float after launch to store live herring caught by jigging with barbless single hooks.
