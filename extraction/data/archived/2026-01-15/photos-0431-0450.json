We had an old oil fired kitchen range for many years. While it was smelly at times, and a little finicky to get started, it not only cooked but heated, allowing the cabin to stay warm all night. Note the old garage in the background. This was torn down in the 1980's. I invited one of my business partners Robb Dale to spend the weekend taking out our frustrations on the old garage with a maul and various saws. He loved it, and it was gone by the end of the weekend. Sort of like a demolition derby where you paid to bash an old car.",
