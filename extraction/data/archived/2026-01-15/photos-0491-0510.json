After she foundered in Bellingham Bay in 1895 (one person was killed), she was raised and put into service as a ferry and charter for hire. But no one seemed leery of coming aboard again, especially not these passengers, dressed to party in derbies and dresses for a Fourth of July outing.",

Once we were comfortable with that we learned to put a single ski on our 'skiing foot' and one of the old double skis on the other. We would start out on two and ultimately drop the old double ski and ski the rest of the ride on one. Single skiing was vastly better. You could ski in rougher water, cut corners like a snow skier, and even jump the boat's wake. In later years, and more powerful boats, we could jump from one side of the wake to the other and reach down and touch the tip of the ski before landing. This could also result in a spectacular crash. Fortunately in those years our bodies were made of rubber and nobody ever got hurt.",
