This was a tiny little house about a block or two from the Reinell Boat Co. and the smell of cedar was always present. Ken would go over and pick up cedar scraps that were left on their burn pile. He built a rabbit hutch out of those scraps and mounted it in his bedroom window so that the rabbit could be both inside and outside - pretty cold in that bedroom. (Ken)"

Practically neighbors, the Richard Willis and George Culver families became well acquainted. Lack of mechanization made early farming an arduous task requiring more labor than was often available in one family. On certain occasions, such as harvest time, neighbors would team up and help one another. Other times it was necessary to hire help, and there were plenty of young men around who needed work. This photograph shows Cecil Willis, son of Richard Willis, who has been hired to help bring in the hay on Alderbrook Farm. The Culver's farmhouse is in the background.",

The materials were barged from Bellingham to the Point Lawrence beach and carried to the site by horse-drawn wagon. The builders lived on the site during construction and were paid $1 per day plus board. The house and farm became the Culver's permanent residence. In 1894 Otis became the owner of the \"Islander\" newspaper in Friday Harbor, where he made his home. The Alderbrook farmhouse is owned by descendants of the Culver family, who have kept it in its original 1889 configuration. In 1985 it was listed on the National Register of Historic properties.",
