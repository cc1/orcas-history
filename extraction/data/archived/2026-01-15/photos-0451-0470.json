It nearly jumped out of the water - and was a great ski boat for anyone who wished to chance it. In return they would then have to drive the boat so I could ski! That thing flew - without a doubt one of the fastest things anywhere near Pt. Lawrence. I sold it a couple of years later to buy an inboard boat which I named Circe' after the Greek Goddess of Magic.
