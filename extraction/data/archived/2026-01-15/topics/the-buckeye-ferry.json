      "content": "At 61.5 feet long and 19.8 feet abeam, the ship was stubby in comparison with sleek Mosquito Fleet vessels such as the Rosalie. Built in Seattle in 1890, she displaced 80 tons and drew 7.1 feet of water, which enabled her to call at low tide in many harbors. After she foundered in Bellingham Bay in 1895 (one person was killed), she was raised and put into service as a ferry and charter for hire. But no one seemed leery of coming aboard again, especially not these passengers, dressed to party in derbies and dresses for a Fourth of July outing.",
