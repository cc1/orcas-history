      "content": "According to records O.H. Culver leased and later purchased a large amount of land here for a 'gentlemen's farm' in order to raise fruits commercially before the advent of irrigation in Eastern Washington. The site was picked because it contained the most easterly location for a steamboat landing in a well sheltered cove. O.H. Culver built the home in 1889 with the help of his father George Nelson Culver and numerous hired help. G.N. ran the farm until 1914 when a farming injury forced him to leave and spend the rest of his days in Friday Harbor at the home of his son O.H. Culver. George and his wife Diana planted extensive orchards of apples, cherries, and Italian plums. In addition they raised animals including cattle and oxford down sheep. The farmhouse remains to this day."
