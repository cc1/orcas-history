Over the years he appeared on stage as Charlie Chaplin (very funny skit with camera on tripod that would not stand up when he turned around) and Al Jolson (one of his favorite singers). Yes, he appeared in black face with the big white lips - I believe it was pantomime. Not sure what this one was as I did not see it. (Ken)"

When Marcia and Ken were married Gary and Maury moved out, and Marcia stayed until spring when she travelled to Sitka Alaska to teach and be closer to Ken who was assigned as the Commanding Officer of an isolated duty station on Biorka Island, 15 miles away in the Alaska Gulf.
